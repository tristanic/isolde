	1 In consideration of the downloading of the Software by the Licensee and
	the acceptance of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor grants the
	Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence, for internal
	academic, not-for-profit use only, for any user within the User Definition
	to install, load, display, run and make necessary back-up copies of the
	Software during the Licence Period upon the following terms:
</p>
<p>
	2 The Licensee may correct errors, modify the Software and create
	derivative works. The Licensee shall copy all error corrections promptly to
	the Licensor and hereby assigns copyright in them to the Licensor. The
	Licensee shall own modifications and derivative works it makes of the
	Software but not any Software incorporated in them. The restrictions in
	clause 3 shall also apply to any modification or derivative work, to the
	extent that it is based on or utilises the Software, unless the Licensor's
	prior written consent to vary the restrictions has been obtained. Such
	consent shall be subject to payment and to such other terms as may be fair
	and reasonable in the circumstances.
</p>
<p>
	3 The Licensee shall not distribute, sub-license, sell, lend, provide
	access (including without limitation via a public-access internet site) to
	the whole or any part of the Software or use it to process the work of any
	third party.
</p>
<p>
	4 The Licensee shall supervise the use of the Software, control access to
	it and keep it secure. The Licensee remains fully responsible at all times
	for all acts and omissions of anyone it allows to use the Software and for
	ensuring such person understands and observes this Licence. This
	responsibility includes without limitation any employee, student,
	independent contractor or visiting researcher.
</p>
<p>
	5 Except for the rights expressly set out in this Licence, no licence
	is granted and all rights, title, interest in and to the Software
	(including without limitation any patent rights) in all formats and
	media throughout the world now or hereafter are and shall remain the
	exclusive property of the Licensor and other rights holders.
</p>
<p>
	6 The Licensee shall acknowledge the Authors and use of the Software in the
	publication of any results achieved through use of the Software.
</p>
<p>
	The Licensee shall reproduce a copyright notice on every copy of the
	Software (including partial copies) and on any accompanying manuals and
	documentation in the form "Copyright &#169; The Chancellor, Masters, and
	Scholars of the University of Cambridge. All rights reserved." with the
	date the Software was written inserted after the sign "&#169;". Trademark
	and other proprietary notices must also be reproduced but the Licensee has
	no other right to use the name, arms, trademark, logo or other designation
	of the Authors or the Licensor.

<p>
	7 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is confidential. Unless
	required to disclose by law, stock exchange or in connection with legal
	proceedings the Licensee shall keep the Software confidential and
	secret, together with all know-how, techniques, ideas, principles and
	concepts which underlie the Software and all information supplied by
	the Licensor in relation to the Software or which is otherwise
	identified as confidential.
</p>
<p>
	The obligations in this Clause do not apply to information which is in or
	becomes part of the public domain in a lawful manner. The obligations in
	this Clause shall survive the expiry or earlier termination (for whatever
	reason) of the LicencePeriodfor a period of three years.
</p>
<p>
	8 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is at an early stage of
	development and is not error-free, that it is provided "AS IS" and that
	specific results and uninterrupted running cannot be expected. The Licensee
	therefore agrees that the existence of errors in the Software shall not
	constitute a breach of this Licence. The Licensor shall not be required to
	load, test, debug, maintain or improve the Software.
</p>
<p>
	9 NO WARRANTY, CONDITION, UNDERTAKING OR TERM, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
	STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, IS GIVEN OR ASSUMED BY THE LICENSOR, INCLUDING
	WITHOUT LIMITATION AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OR THE CONDITION, PERFORMANCE,
	SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE OF THE SOFTWARE AND ALL SUCH
	WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND TERMS ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED TO THE
	FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
</p>
<p>
	10 The limitations and exclusions in this Licence shall not apply in
	respect of claims for personal injury or death caused by negligence or
	in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>
	11 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY CLAUSE 10, NEITHER THE LICENSOR OR ITS EMPLOYEES
	OR STUDENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR EXPENSES OF WHATSOEVER
	NATURE AND HOWSOEVER ARISING (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IN CONTRACT,
	TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR FOR BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR MISREPRESENTATION) IN
	CONNECTION WITH ANY RIGHT OR LICENCE GRANTED OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR
	OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENCE OR ANY RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED
	BY IT. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, IN THE EVENT
	THAT THE LICENSOR, ITS EMPLOYEES OR STUDENTS SHOULD BE FOUND LIABLE, THEN
	THEIR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL BE LIMITED TO
	&#163;1,000; AND NONE OF THEM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
	CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF
	PROFITS, REVENUE, OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, DATA LOSS,
	BUSINESS DISRUPTION OR COMPUTER FAILURE.
</p>
<p>
	12 The Licensor may terminate the Licence Period early by written
	notice if the Licensee fails to comply with any provision of this
	Licence within 14 days of being required to do so in writing. Upon
	termination the Licensee shall immediately stop using the Software and
	shall certify to the Licensor within 5 days that the Licensee has
	removed all copies from its systems. The expiry or termination of the
	Licence Period is without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of
	either party under the Licence or at law and does not affect any rights
	or obligations which have arisen or accrued up to and including the
	date of expiry or termination. Clauses 5, 7 to 12 inclusive and 14, and
	16 shall survive termination or expiry.
</p>
<p>
	13 The Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of
	this Licence, without the Licensor's prior written consent.
</p>
<p>
	14 This Licence and any matters relating to it shall be governed and
	construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The parties
	hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English
	Courts, except that a party may seek an interim injunction in any court
	of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
	15 This Licence constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the
	Licensor and Licensee relating to the subject matter of this Licence. This
	Licence cannot be waived or varied except in writing signed by the
	Licensor. If the whole or any part of a provision of this Licence is void,
	unenforceable or illegal in a jurisdiction, it is severed for that
	jurisdiction, unless it alters the basic nature of this Licence or is
	contrary to public policy.
</p>
<p>
	16 This Licence does not constitute one party the partner, agent, or
	legal representative of the other. The Licensor its employees and
	students may enforce terms which expressly confer rights on them,
	subject to and in accordance with the Contracts (Rights of Third
	Parties) Act 1999. Save as aforesaid no term of this Licence shall be
	enforceable under that Act by a person who is not a party to this
	Licence.
</p>
<p>
	17 Notices shall be served on the other party's Contact at the Address and
	shall be deemed served on delivery (or upon confirmed successful fax
	transmission) on a working day before 5pm or within 3 working days of first
	class posting in the UK, 7 working days if posted outside the UK.
