Starting ISOLDE
---------------

Assuming you already have ISOLDE installed (if not, you can do so via
*Tools/More Tools...* in the ChimeraX menu), then you can start it up via
*Tools/General/ISOLDE* or by typing ``isolde start`` in the command line. This
should yield a new floating panel looking something like this:

.. image:: images/isolde_initial_screen.png
    :alt: Initial GUI appearance

*(NOTE: the ISOLDE panel is designed to be similar in size to the ChimeraX Log
panel on most machines, and will "dock" there if dragged onto it. If working
with a single display I recommend doing this.)*

If you already have a model loaded, you'll probably notice that it's gained a
few (but hopefully not **too** many) new features like those in the image below.
If not, go ahead and load a model using the standard ChimeraX interface. If you
have multiple models open, you can choose the one you want to work on using the
"Working on:" drop-down menu at the top-left of the ISOLDE panel.

    +---+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | a | Crosshairs denoting the pivot point (centre of rotation) of  |
    |   | the display. Red, green and blue point along the x, y and z  |
    |   | axes respectively. Under normal circumstances the centre of  |
    |   | rotation should remain in the middle of the screen - if for  |
    |   | any reason you find it stops behaving as expected, this      |
    |   | behaviour can be reinstated using the command                |
    |   | ``cofr center showpivot true``.                              |
    +---+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | b | This exclamation mark/spiral motif denotes a rotamer outlier |
    |   | (that is, a sidechain in an unlikely conformation). The more |
    |   | unlikely the conformation, the larger and redder the         |
    |   | indicator becomes. Below and to the left you can see a less  |
    |   | severe "iffy" rotamer.                                       |
    +---+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    | c | The red trapezoids you see here are highlighting non-proline |
    |   | *cis* peptide bonds (where the amide hydrogen and carbonyl   |
    |   | oxygen are pointing in the same direction). In the real world|
    |   | these are vanishingly rare (around 3 per 10,000 amino acid   |
    |   | residues), and real ones tend to be heavily stabilised by    |
    |   | surrounding packing/H-bond interactions (and hence are       |
    |   | usually among the better-resolved sites in the molecule). A  |
    |   | string of non-proline *cis* bonds on a flexible loop as seen |
    |   | here is essentially impossible. The less-rare proline *cis*  |
    |   | bonds are similarly shown in green, and peptide bonds twisted|
    |   | more than 30 degrees from planar in yellow.                  |
    +---+--------------------------------------------------------------+
    |d,e| The protein backbone is not infinitely free to move, but has |
    |   | clearly preferred conformations that have been well          |
    |   | characterised by studying high-resolution structures. The    |
    |   | best-established method for characterising backbone          |
    |   | conformation is via the Ramachandran plot, a plot of the phi |
    |   | (C-N-CA-C) and psi (N-CA-C-N) dihedral angles against each   |
    |   | other.                                                       |
    |   |                                                              |
    |   | The probabilities of finding different (phi, psi)            |
    |   | combinations have been mapped out in high detail for         |
    |   | various groups of amino acids (MolProbity_). While ISOLDE    |
    |   | also provides a Ramachandran plot, the current probability   |
    |   | score for each protein residue is mapped in real time to the |
    |   | colour of its alpha carbon (CA) atom as shown. Green denotes |
    |   | a "happy" residue, yellow is marginal (possible, but somewhat|
    |   | strained), and red is a serious outlier (still possible, but |
    |   | needs very strong support to justify it).                    |

*(Note: The rotamer, peptide bond and Ramachandran markups described above
update automatically whenever the atomic coordinates change. As long as you have
ISOLDE installed, you can add them to any loaded model using the* ``rama`` *and*
``rota`` *commands)*

.. _preparing-a-model:

Preparing a model for simulation
--------------------------------

*(Note: if you just want to load up a model and maps ready to play with, just
click the "Load demo" button in the top left of the ISOLDE panel)*

While getting a clear picture of potential problems in a model is already
somewhat useful, what ISOLDE is really all about is *fixing* them. To do that,
it needs to be able to run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This in turn
imposes a few requirements:

  1.  It must consist of residues that the MD engine knows about

      That is, each residue must have a corresponding definition in the MD
      *forcefield* dictating all the details of bond lengths, angles, charges,
      atomic radii etc. As of version 1.0b3, ISOLDE supports protein, nucleic
      acid, most common sugars, water, metal ions, and approx. 13,000 of the
      more common ligands in the Chemical Components Dictionary. If your ligand
      is not recognised, you will need to provide AMBER-compatible parameters in
      the `OpenMM ffXML format`__.

      __ http://docs.openmm.org/7.0.0/userguide/application.html#creating-force-fields

      These can be conveniently converted from AMBER .mol2 and .frcmod files
      using ParmEd_. One convenient option for preparing the .mol2 and .frcmod
      files themselves is Phenix AmberPrep_.

.. _ParmEd: https://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html

.. _AmberPrep: https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/amber.html

      An integrated ligand paramterisation framework is planned for a future
      release.

  2.  Each individual residue must be complete, including all hydrogens

      (Yes, even water). In MD every atom plays a role - the engine needs every
      atom present to determine what sort of residue it's dealing with.
      Nevertheless, in keeping with the fact that ISOLDE is about model building
      and refinement rather than traditional equilibrium MD, a few artificial
      arrangements are allowed. In particular, it is *not* necessary to "cap"
      dangling N- and C-termini (or 5' and 3' termini in nucleic acids) at chain
      breaks:

      .. figure:: images/nterm.png
        :alt: Dangling N-terminal residue

        This dangling N-terminus is fine

      .. figure:: images/cterm.png
        :alt: Dangling C-terminal residue

        \.. as is this dangling C-terminus

      Additionally, for all protein residues other than proline, sidechain
      truncations to CA, CB, CG or CD are allowed.

      The most convenient way to add hydrogens (in a manner that follows the
      above rules) is by using the ChimeraX `addh`` command. Type ``usage addh``
      in the ChimeraX command line for complete instructions, but in most cases
      ``addh hbond true`` will give you the most desirable result.

      *(Note: if you have metal ions present and your geometry is not perfect,
      you may find* ``addh`` *refusing to protonate one or more nearby peptide
      nitrogens. If you run into this issue try adding the argument*
      ``metalDist 1.0`` *to your* ``addh`` *command.)*

      In general, I recommend adding sidechains wherever possible - even if
      there is minimal density to support them, in the MD environment the
      contributions from each sidechain generally help in maintaining the
      geometry of surrounding residues. Sidechains can be conveniently rebuilt
      using the `swapaa` mouse mode provided by ChimeraX and found in the "Right
      Mouse" tab in the menu ribbon above the  main GUI:

      .. figure:: images/swapaa.png
        :alt: SwapAA mouse mode icon

      Right-clicking on a protein atom and dragging up/down will iterate through
      building all standard amino acid residues. Using this tool to simply
      "mutate" the residue to its own identity will give you a complete
      sidechain.

      **(IMPORTANT NOTE: Never perform edits that add or remove atoms
      while a simulation is running)**

  3.  Alternative conformations (altlocs - that is, the same atom in two or more
      different places) are not currently supported. This is usually not a
      problem, since at the resolutions ISOLDE can help the most altlocs aren't
      generally resolvable in the data anyway!

.. _adding-maps:

Adding maps
-----------

The primary use of ISOLDE is of course the fitting and refinement of an atomic
model into one or more experimental maps. This is achieved via an interactive
implementation of `molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF)`__. In brief, MDFF
converts your map into a field of potential energies overlaid on a molecular
dynamics simulation, with each feeling a force proportional to the energy
gradient at its current position. In effect, this causes atoms to "fall" into
the high-density regions of the map.

__ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430731/

ISOLDE is designed with the aim of seamless operability between direct
real-space maps (e.g. as generated from cryo-EM experiments) and maps calculated
from reciprocal-space data (typically derived from x-ray crystallography).
Depending on your needs, three general types of maps are supported as described
below, and a model may be associated with any combination (and any number,
memory permitting) of these map types.

Real-space maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**(NOTE: within ChimeraX, you may prefer to familiarise yourself with the
use of real-space maps in the interactive :ref:`bulk_fitting_tutorial` tutorial.)**

Any real-space map format recognised by ChimeraX can be used as a MDFF
potential by ISOLDE with a few simple steps. Simply load your model, e.g.

``open 6eyd; open 3983 from emdb``

If the model and map are not perfectly aligned, you can easily obtain an
optimised rigid-body fit using ChimeraX's ``fitmap`` command.

``fitmap #1 inMap #2 moveWholeMolecules false``

Once aligned, the map may be associated with the model either by using the
"Associate real-space map with current model" button on the ISOLDE "Sim
settings" tab, or

``clipper associate #2 toModel #1``

**(IMPORTANT NOTE: rigid-body fitting of the model into the map must be done
BEFORE running "clipper associate".)**

This should change your view of the model and map from something like this:

.. figure:: images/6eyd_with_map_initial.png
    :alt: Default ChimeraX model/map view

to a visualisation mode similar to the traditional crystallographic view:

.. figure:: images/6eyd_with_map_clipper.png
    :alt: View after registering map with Clipper

    Default Clipper/ISOLDE "spotlight" model/map view. The map appears as a
    sphere of density around the centre of rotation. Residues with atoms within
    the spotlight radius have their atoms shown; the remainder of the molecule
    is shown as a cartoon. You can adjust the spotlight radius using the command
    ``clipper spotlight radius <radius>`` - but keep in mind that radii much larger
    than about 20Å will cause noticeable lag in navigation.

Upon registration, ISOLDE automatically registers the map as a MDFF potential.
The coupling constant (defining how strongly the map "pulls" on atoms) is
automatically set by analysis of the gradients in the region close to the
atomic model.

X-ray maps (or other maps calculated from Fourier coefficients)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An x-ray crystallography experiment yields a set of measured intensities
corresponding to the amplitude component of the Fourier transform of the
electron density in the crystal environment. In order to generate a real-space
map, the amplitudes must be combined with a matching set of phases. The core
challenge in crystallography is that the original phase information is not
measurable, and hence estimates may be obtained by other means. Initial phases
are typically obtained by molecular replacement with a close homologue, and/or
anomalous scattering by one or more types of heavy atom in the crystal. These
are then improved by building and refining your model into the map - as the
quality of the model improves, the quality of the map improves, allowing
further improvement to the model, etc..

Initial solution of the phase problem (e.g. with the aid of *Phaser*) and, if
necessary, building of as much of the model as possible using tools like
*phenix.autobuild* should already have happened before you load your model
into ISOLDE. At this point, you have two choices:

* Use "live" maps calculated directly from your model and the experimental
  amplitudes (preferred); or
* Use "static" maps derived from pre-calculated amplitudes and phases
  (e.g. as output from *phenix.refine* or *phenix.maps*).

Both options have their own pros and cons, and are described in detail below.
In either case, the input is an MTZ file. ISOLDE will automatically generate
live or static maps (or a combination of both types) depending on what it
finds in the loaded file. Crystallographic maps may be added to the model
currently selected in ISOLDE using the "Load crystallographic dataset" button,
or added to any atomic model using a command such as:

``open reflections.mtz structureModel #1``

Multiple crystallographic datasets may be associated with a single model, as
long as the space group and cell dimensions match. Maps will be generated for
each data column recognised by the Clipper plugin. Any unwanted maps may be
safely closed via ChimeraX's model panel:

.. figure:: images/model_panel_complex_dataset.png
    :alt: A rather over-complicated map arrangement

    The ChimeraX model panel showing six crystallographic maps and one non-
    crystallographic map associated with an atomic model. The unwanted maps may
    be closed by selecting their entry in the tree then clicking the "Close"
    button at top right. You can close an entire crystallographic dataset by
    selecting the corresponding entry with name starting "Crystallographic maps".

Static (pre-calculated) crystallographic maps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**(WARNING: in many refinement packages (including PHENIX) the default
behaviour is to include the free reflections when generating maps for
visualisation and manual model building. By Parseval's theorem this is
equivalent in effect to including these reflections when refining in reciprocal
space. While this may be OK when changing only a small fraction of the model, a
typical MDFF session re-fits every atom to the map. While there is still some
argument as to the final effect of this, using maps including the free set WILL
render R_free and R_free-R_work unreliable as measures of the quality of fit.
Unfortunately there is no way to determine whether an arbitrary set of
amplitudes and phases includes the free set or not, so it is up to you to ensure
that free reflections are NOT included. A template for a suitable phenix.maps
input file is provided below. For the above reasons, all static maps will be
disabled as MDFF potentials by default, and must be explicitly enabled for
simulation using the controls under the "Show map settings dialogue" button.)**

The Clipper plugin uses some very simple heuristics to decide on the treatment
of a given set of amplitudes and phases. In brief, if the name of the amplitude
column is "F" or "FWT" or contains a 2, the resulting map will be treated as
standard map (that is, displayed with a single positive contour and used as a
MDFF potential). Any map  for which the amplitude column name is "FC" or
contains "CALC" (case-insensitive) will be treated as an Fcalc map and hidden by
default. Any column name not matching the above criteria will result in a
difference map (equal positive and negative displayed contours, not used for
MDFF).

Live crystallographic maps **(EXPERIMENTAL)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**(NOTE: This feature is still experimental and undergoing further
development. While it works well given good-quality data, its handling of
outliers and pathologies such as ice rings, beam-stop shadows, anisotropy
etc. is minimal to non-existent. If the R-factors calculated are more than
~5% higher than those calculated by your favourite refinement package, you
may be safer sticking with pre-calculated maps for now.)**

If your MTZ file contains experimental intensities (I/sigI) or amplitudes
(F/sigF), then a set of live sigma-a weighted crystallographic maps will be
generated directly from the combination of these with phases calculated from the
atomic model. Unlike with the pre-calculated maps, any changes to the atomic
model automatically triggers a recalculation of all live maps. This happens in
the background, with minimal effect on graphical performance other than a slight
pause when the visualisation of the new maps is loaded in.

*(NOTE: live updating can be toggled using the "Live crystallographic map
calculation" checkbox that appears on the "Sim settings" tab when a live dataset
is associated with the selected model)*

*(NOTE: live map updates do not update the MDFF potential while a simulation is
running. The potential will only change once the simulation is finished.)*

Working directly with the experimental data has the distinct advantage that
ISOLDE can know and control exactly what goes into each map. Three maps
will be generated for visualisation purposes:

* a standard 2mFo-DFc map
* a 2mFo-DFc map with a moderate amount of B-factor sharpening or
  smoothing applied (with the amount of sharpening/smoothing decided
  heuristically based on resolution)
* a mFo-DFc difference map

Each of the above maps is generated using the full set of reflections, and
for this reason is blocked from use as a MDFF potential. Instead, ISOLDE
also creates a special map (helpfully named "(LIVE) MDFF potential")
optimised for use as a MDFF potential (including exclusion of the free set).
This map is hidden by default, but can be displayed via the Model Panel at
any time.
