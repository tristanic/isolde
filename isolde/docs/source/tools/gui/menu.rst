When you start ISOLDE, a new "ISOLDE" entry will appear in the main ChimeraX
menu. This provides access to various small, occasionally-used functions.

Model Building
--------------

* **Add Hydrogen:** add a single hydrogen in a chemically-sensible position to the
  currently selected atom, if supported by its chemical state. If addition of
  another hydrogen is not chemically sensible it will not be placed.

* **Add Oxt:** add an OXT atom to a C-terminal amino acid residue to form the
  carboxylic acid. In general this should only be done for *true* C-terminal
  residues, unless you are certain that this is a proteolytic cleavage site.

* **Make Bond:** create a bond between two selected atoms. Use with care: this
  method does **not** check for chemical sensibility, nor delete hydrogens.

* **Merge Models Into Working Model:** takes all models with at least one atom
  selected and merges copies of them into ISOLDE's current working model. Chains
  in the added models will be renamed as necessary to avoid conflicts.

* **Protonate Acid Sidechain:** if a Glu or Asp residue is selected, adds a 
  hydrogen to one of its acid oxygens.

* **Remove All Altlocs:** delete all alternate conformers in the model, setting 
  the occupancies for the remaining active altloc atoms to 1.0.

* **Remove Bond:** delete a bond between two selected atoms. As for *Make Bond*,
  this does not make any other modifications to the model such as addition/
  removal of hydrogens. 

Disulphides
~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Break Disulphide:** break the disulphide bond between two selected cysteine
  residues, adding hydrogens if hydrogens are present in the rest of the model

* **Create Disulphide:** create a disulphide bond between two selected residues

* **Make All Sensible Disulphides:** find and bond all pairs of cysteine residues in
  your model whose sulphur atoms are within 3 Angstroms of each other but not
  bonded. If three or more cysteine residues are clustered in an ambiguous
  manner, they will not be bonded and a warning message with their identities
  will be printed to the log. *(NOTE: this will only be effective if used before running
  simulations - afterwards, the sulphur atoms will be pushed too far apart to be 
  recognised as potential disulphides)*

Prep
----

* **Convert Amber Files:** *(Deprecated for most purposes - for most common
  ligands, use ISOLDE's Residue Parameterisation widget)*. Looks in the current
  working directory for pairs of files named ({name}.frcmod, {name}.mol2) (i.e.
  generated by AMBER's ANTECHAMBER for a new ligand), and converts each pair
  into the OpenMM ffXML format required by ISOLDE. Use ISOLDE's "Load residue MD
  definition(s)" button to allow simulation of these residues.

  *NOTE: this tool requires ParmEd, which is not currently part of the ChimeraX
  distribution. If you don't have it, you will be given the choice to
  automatically install it. Installation of ParmEd requires the availability of
  a compiler on your system path - for Linux this is generally no problem, but
  in MacOS you will need to have XCode installed while in Windows you will need
  a recent Visual Studio installation.*

*NOTE: the following two tools require Phenix and ParmEd. Phenix must have the
$PHENIX environment variable set (e.g. by running "source phenix_env.sh" prior
to starting ChimeraX)*

* **Convert pLDDT to B-factors:** models predicted by AlphaFold2 and its variants 
  fill the B-factor column with predicted Local Distance Difference Test 
  (pLDDT) values, which have an inverse relationship to B-factors. Use this 
  to convert these to estimated B-factors in ISOLDE's current model.
