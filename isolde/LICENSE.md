1.  In consideration of the downloading of the Software by the Licensee
    and the acceptance of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor grants
    the Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable licence, for
    internal academic, not-for-profit use only, for any user within the
    User Definition to install, load, display, run and make necessary
    back-up copies of the Software during the Licence Period upon the
    following terms:

<!-- end list -->

1.  The Licensee may correct errors, modify the Software and create
    derivative works. The Licensee shall copy all error corrections
    promptly to the Licensor and hereby assigns copyright in them to the
    Licensor. The Licensee shall own modifications and derivative works
    it makes of the Software but not any Software incorporated in them.
    The restrictions in clause 3 shall also apply to any modification or
    derivative work, to the extent that it is based on or utilises the
    Software, unless the Licensor’s prior written consent to vary the
    restrictions has been obtained. Such consent shall be subject to
    payment and to such other terms as may be fair and reasonable in the
    circumstances.

2.  The Licensee shall not distribute, sub-license, sell, lend, provide
    access (including without limitation via a public-access internet
    site) to the whole or any part of the Software or use it to process
    the work of any third party.

3.  The Licensee shall supervise the use of the Software, control access
    to it and keep it secure. The Licensee remains fully responsible at
    all times for all acts and omissions of anyone it allows to use the
    Software and for ensuring such person understands and observes this
    Licence. This responsibility includes without limitation any
    employee, student, independent contractor or visiting researcher.

4.  Except for the rights expressly set out in this Licence, no licence
    is granted and all rights, title, interest in and to the Software
    (including without limitation any patent rights) in all formats and
    media throughout the world now or hereafter are and shall remain the
    exclusive property of the Licensor and other rights holders.

5.  The Licensee shall acknowledge the Authors and use of the Software
    in the publication of any results achieved through use of the
    Software.

    The Licensee shall reproduce a copyright notice on every copy of the
    Software (including partial copies) and on any accompanying manuals
    and documentation in the form “Copyright © The Chancellor, Masters,
    and Scholars of the University of Cambridge. All rights reserved.”
    with the date the Software was written inserted after the sign “©”.
    Trademark and other proprietary notices must also be reproduced but
    the Licensee has no other right to use the name, arms, trademark, logo
    or other designation of the Authors or the Licensor.

6.  The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is confidential. Unless
    required to disclose by law, stock exchange or in connection with
    legal proceedings the Licensee shall keep the Software confidential
    and secret, together with all know-how, techniques, ideas,
    principles and concepts which underlie the Software and all
    information supplied by the Licensor in relation to the Software or
    which is otherwise identified as confidential.

    The obligations in this Clause do not apply to information which is in
    or becomes part of the public domain in a lawful manner. The
    obligations in this Clause shall survive the expiry or earlier
    termination (for whatever reason) of the Licence Period for a period
    of three years.

7.  The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is at an early stage of
    development and is not error-free, that it is provided “as is” and
    that specific results and uninterrupted running cannot be expected.
    The Licensee therefore agrees that the existence of errors in the
    Software shall not constitute a breach of this Licence. The Licensor
    shall not be required to load, test, debug, maintain or improve the
    Software.

8.  No warranty, condition, undertaking or term, express or implied,
    statutory or otherwise, is given or assumed by the Licensor,
    including without limitation as to non-infringement or the
    condition, performance, satisfactory quality or fitness for purpose
    of the Software and all such warranties, conditions, undertakings
    and terms are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by
    law.

9.  The limitations and exclusions in this Licence shall not apply in
    respect of claims for personal injury or death caused by negligence
    or in respect of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

10. Except as provided by Clause 9, neither the Licensor or its
    employees or students shall be liable for any damages or expenses of
    whatsoever nature and howsoever arising (including without
    limitation in contract, tort, negligence or for breach of statutory
    duty or misrepresentation) in connection with any right or licence
    granted or use of the Software or otherwise in connection with this
    Licence or any relationships established by it. Without prejudice to
    the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Licensor, its
    employees or students should be found liable, then their aggregate
    liability for direct damages shall be limited to £1,000; and none of
    them shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential or
    special damages including without limitation loss of profits,
    revenue, or business opportunity, loss of goodwill, data loss,
    business disruption or computer failure.

11. The Licensor may terminate the Licence Period early by written
    notice if the Licensee fails to comply with any provision of this
    Licence within 14 days of being required to do so in writing. Upon
    termination the Licensee shall immediately stop using the Software
    and shall certify to the Licensor within 5 days that the Licensee
    has removed all copies from its systems. The expiry or termination
    of the Licence Period is without prejudice to any other rights or
    remedies of either party under the Licence or at law and does not
    affect any rights or obligations which have arisen or accrued up to
    and including the date of expiry or termination. Clauses 4, 6 to 11
    inclusive and 13, and 15 shall survive termination or expiry.

12. The Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer all or any part
    of this Licence, without the Licensor’s prior written consent.

13. This Licence and any matters relating to it shall be governed and
    construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. The
    parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
    the English Courts, except that a party may seek an interim
    injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction.

14. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of
    the Licensor and Licensee relating to the subject matter of this
    Licence. This Licence cannot be waived or varied except in writing
    signed by the Licensor. If the whole or any part of a provision of
    this Licence is void, unenforceable or illegal in a jurisdiction, it
    is severed for that jurisdiction, unless it alters the basic nature
    of this Licence or is contrary to public policy.

15. This Licence does not constitute one party the partner, agent, or
    legal representative of the other. The Licensor its employees and
    students may enforce terms which expressly confer rights on them,
    subject to and in accordance with the Contracts (Rights of Third
    Parties) Act 1999. Save as aforesaid no term of this Licence shall
    be enforceable under that Act by a person who is not a party to this
    Licence.

16. Notices shall be served on the other party’s Contact at the Address
    and shall be deemed served on delivery (or upon confirmed successful
    fax transmission) on a working day before 5pm or within 3 working
    days of first class posting in the UK, 7 working days if posted
    outside the UK.
